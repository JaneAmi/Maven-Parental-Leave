# Maven-Parental-Leave
This project is inspired by [Maven Family Leave Challenge](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-family-leave-challenge) and vizisualized Parental Leave Policies Across the Business World.

As a Data Visualization Specialist, I worked on a project to create impactful visuals for an online business journal article about parental leave policies across the business world, in celebration of Women's History Month in the United States.

I was provided with a dataset containing a CSV table with 1,601 records, one for each company. Each record contained the company's name and industry, as well as crowdsourced information on the paid and unpaid weeks off they offer as part of both their maternity and paternity leave policies (when available).

To create the visualizations, I used Python and its popular data science and visualization libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pywaffle for wafflecharts.

After cleaning and processing the data, I created several charts and visuals that conveyed the key insights from the dataset.

The final deliverable was a set of high-quality visuals in PNG format, which could be used to support the article and engage the readers. The visuals effectively highlighted the best practices of industries that prioritize work-life balance and gender equality.

The project is presented at Maven Analitics.
